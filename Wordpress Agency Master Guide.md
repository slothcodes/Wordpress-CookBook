# 4. Agency Coding Standards

This section outlines the coding standards and best practices that our agency adheres to, ensuring high-quality, maintainable, and collaborative WordPress development.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 4.1 General Coding Principles

### Readability and Maintainability
- Code should be self-explanatory. Example: Use `$user_count` instead of `$uc` for clarity.
- Implement a consistent coding style, like always placing opening braces on the same line as the function declaration.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle
- Reuse code with functions. Example: Create a `get_formatted_date()` function used across multiple templates instead of repeating date formatting logic.
- Utilize WordPress hooks to modify core functionality without altering core files.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle
- Opt for simpler solutions. Example: Use WordPress built-in functions like `wp_enqueue_script()` instead of manually echoing script tags.

### Modular Development
- Break code into smaller, reusable modules. Example: Develop a separate module for handling custom post type registration.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 4.2 WordPress-Specific Coding Standards

### Following WordPress Core Standards
- Adhere to standards for [indentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/#indentation) (use tabs), [naming files](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions), etc.

### Naming Conventions
- Prefix functions to avoid conflicts. Example: `mytheme_custom_header()` instead of `custom_header()`.

### WordPress Security Practices
- Sanitize inputs using WordPress functions like `sanitize_text_field()`.
- Escape outputs with functions like `esc_html()` or `esc_attr()`.

### File and Folder Structure
- Organize theme files according to the [WordPress template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 4.3 Code Formatting and Commenting Guidelines

### Code Formatting Rules
- Use [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with WordPress rulesets for consistent formatting.
- Example: Format PHP code with proper spacing around operators.

### Commenting Best Practices
- Document complex sections. Example:
 ```
  // Calculate and return the discounted price
  function calculate_discounted_price($price, $discount) {
      return $price - ($price * ($discount / 100));
  }
```
- Use PHPDoc for documenting functions. Example:
```
/**
 * Retrieves formatted date.
 *
 * @param string $date Date string.
 * @return string Formatted date.
 */
function get_formatted_date($date) {
    // Function body...
}
```
### Documentation Standards
- Inline comments for tricky parts. Example: Explain why a certain workaround is used in a specific plugin or theme.

## 5.1 Introduction to Version Control with Git

### What is Version Control
- Version control systems (VCS) allow you to track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate on code.
- VCS is a critical tool in modern software development, offering backup and undo options, as well as collaborative features.

### Basics of Git
- Git is a distributed VCS, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without interference.
- Basic operations include:
  - `git clone`: Copying a repository to your local machine.
  - `git commit`: Saving changes with a descriptive message.
  - `git push`: Uploading local repository content to a remote repository.
  - `git pull`: Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository.

### Setting Up a Git Repository
- Initialize a new Git repository in your WordPress project using `git init`.
- Configure your repository by setting user information with `git config`.

# 6. WordPress Theme Development

This section delves into the essentials of WordPress theme development, focusing on Gutenberg compatibility and the distinction between block and traditional themes.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 6.1 Theme Structure and Hierarchy

### Understanding the WordPress Template Hierarchy
- WordPress uses a specific hierarchy to determine which template file to use. For example, for a single post, it looks for `single.php`, then `singular.php`, and finally `index.php`.
- Example: To create a custom layout for all posts in the 'news' category, one might create a `category-news.php` file.

### Essential Theme Files and Directories
- A basic theme must have `index.php`, `style.css` (with theme header information), and `functions.php`.
- Organize templates into folders like `/partials` for reusable sections like headers and footers (`header.php`, `footer.php`).

### Custom Templates and Template Parts
- Custom templates can be created for specific needs, like `single-book.php` for a custom post type 'book'.
- Template parts are used for common elements: `get_template_part('partials/navigation');` for navigation.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 6.2 Developing Gutenberg-Compatible Themes

### Gutenberg’s Impact on Theme Development
- Gutenberg, with its block-based editing, changes how themes handle content. Themes now need to provide styles for blocks.

### Building for Block Compatibility
- Ensure that themes support Gutenberg by adding styles for default blocks and aligning them with the theme’s design.
- Example: Adding styles for the latest posts block to match the theme's typography and color scheme.

### Theme Support for Gutenberg Features
- Enable support for full-width alignment with `add_theme_support('align-wide');`.
- Define a custom color palette in the theme’s `functions.php` file.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 6.3 Enqueuing Scripts and Styles

### Properly Loading Scripts and Styles
- Scripts and styles should be loaded using `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` within a function hooked to `wp_enqueue_scripts`.

### Managing Dependencies
- Define script dependencies to ensure they load in the correct order. For instance, a custom script dependent on jQuery would list 'jquery' in its dependencies array.

### Best Practices for Performance
- Optimize loading times by minifying scripts and styles. Conditionally load scripts on pages where they are needed.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 6.4 Theme Customization Options

### Using the Customizer API
- Utilize the WordPress Customizer to add options like site logo, background color, or custom header images.
- Example: Adding a custom color picker for the theme's background.

### Creating Custom Theme Settings
- Introduce custom settings like a switch for a dark/light mode or a layout selector.
- Use `add_setting()` and `add_control()` in `customize_register` action hook.

### Integrating with Gutenberg
- Ensure that customizer settings apply appropriate styles in Gutenberg editor. Use `add_editor_style()` to add custom stylesheets to the editor.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 6.5 Understanding Block Themes vs. Traditional Themes

### Differences Between Block and Traditional Themes
- Traditional themes use PHP templates and functions, while block themes utilize HTML templates and `theme.json` for styles and global settings.

### Transitioning to Block Themes
- Transitioning involves understanding how to convert PHP templates into HTML templates and moving styles to `theme.json`.

### Benefits and Limitations of Each Approach
- Block themes provide easier layout customization for end-users, while traditional themes offer developers more control over structure and PHP functionality.

[Return to Top](#comprehensive-guide-for-running-a-wordpress-block-theme-development-agency)

## 6.6 Key Components of a Block Theme

### Understanding `theme.json`
- This file controls the global settings and styles of a block theme, like setting default colors, font sizes, and enabling custom spacing.

### Developing Block Templates and Template Parts
- Block templates are HTML files defining the layout using blocks, e.g., `single.html` for single post layouts.
- Template parts are smaller, reusable HTML files for sections like headers and footers.

### Utilizing Block Patterns
- Create block patterns for frequently used design elements. Example: a call-to-action pattern with a button and text.
