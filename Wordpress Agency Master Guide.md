## 3.2 Coding Custom Post Types: Step-by-Step

### Registering Custom Post Types
- Use `register_post_type()` function in your theme’s `functions.php` or a custom plugin.
- Example:
  ```php
  function create_custom_post_type() {
      register_post_type('custom_type',
          array(
              'labels' => array(
                  'name' => __('Custom Types'),
                  'singular_name' => __('Custom Type')
              ),
              'public' => true,
              'has_archive' => true,
              'show_in_rest' => true,
          )
      );
  }
  add_action('init', 'create_custom_post_type');
  ```
### Setting Up Labels and Descriptions
- Define clear, descriptive labels for the CPT for easy identification in the WordPress dashboard.
### Configuring Options
- Set options like public, has_archive, and show_in_rest for REST API support.

## 3.3 Adding Meta Boxes and Custom Fields
### Creating Meta Boxes
- Add meta boxes to provide a UI for adding custom fields.
- Use add_meta_box() function during the add_meta_boxes hook.
### Defining Custom Fields
- Create fields for additional data like dates, text, or images.
Example:
```
function add_custom_meta_box() {
    add_meta_box('custom_meta', 'Custom Field', 'custom_meta_callback', 'custom_type');
}
add_action('add_meta_boxes', 'add_custom_meta_box');
```
### Saving and Retrieving Data
- Save data using the save_post hook.
- Retrieve data using get_post_meta() function.

## 3.4 Displaying Custom Post Types in Themes
### Theme Template Files
- Create or modify template files like single-custom_type.php for displaying CPTs.
### Custom Queries
- Use WP_Query to create custom queries for your CPTs.
Example:
```
$args = array(
    'post_type' => 'custom_type',
    'posts_per_page' => 10
);
$the_query = new WP_Query($args);
```
### Integrating with Block Themes

# 4. Agency Coding Standards

This section outlines the coding standards and best practices that our agency adheres to, ensuring high-quality, maintainable, and collaborative WordPress development.

## 4.1 General Coding Principles

### Readability and Maintainability
- Code should be self-explanatory. Example: Use `$user_count` instead of `$uc` for clarity.
- Implement a consistent coding style, like always placing opening braces on the same line as the function declaration.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle
- Reuse code with functions. Example: Create a `get_formatted_date()` function used across multiple templates instead of repeating date formatting logic.
- Utilize WordPress hooks to modify core functionality without altering core files.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle
- Opt for simpler solutions. Example: Use WordPress built-in functions like `wp_enqueue_script()` instead of manually echoing script tags.

### Modular Development
- Break code into smaller, reusable modules. Example: Develop a separate module for handling custom post type registration.

## 4.2 WordPress-Specific Coding Standards

### Following WordPress Core Standards
- Adhere to standards for [indentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/#indentation) (use tabs), [naming files](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions), etc.

### Naming Conventions
- Prefix functions to avoid conflicts. Example: `mytheme_custom_header()` instead of `custom_header()`.

### WordPress Security Practices
- Sanitize inputs using WordPress functions like `sanitize_text_field()`.
- Escape outputs with functions like `esc_html()` or `esc_attr()`.

### File and Folder Structure
- Organize theme files according to the [WordPress template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

## 4.3 Code Formatting and Commenting Guidelines

### Code Formatting Rules
- Use [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with WordPress rulesets for consistent formatting.
- Example: Format PHP code with proper spacing around operators.

### Commenting Best Practices
- Document complex sections. Example:
 ```
  // Calculate and return the discounted price
  function calculate_discounted_price($price, $discount) {
      return $price - ($price * ($discount / 100));
  }
```
- Use PHPDoc for documenting functions. Example:
```
/**
 * Retrieves formatted date.
 *
 * @param string $date Date string.
 * @return string Formatted date.
 */
function get_formatted_date($date) {
    // Function body...
}
```
### Documentation Standards
- Inline comments for tricky parts. Example: Explain why a certain workaround is used in a specific plugin or theme.
