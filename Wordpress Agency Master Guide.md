 ```
  // Calculate and return the discounted price
  function calculate_discounted_price($price, $discount) {
      return $price - ($price * ($discount / 100));
  }
```
- Use PHPDoc for documenting functions. Example:
```
/**
 * Retrieves formatted date.
 *
 * @param string $date Date string.
 * @return string Formatted date.
 */
function get_formatted_date($date) {
    // Function body...
}
```

### Basics of Git
- Git is a distributed VCS, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without interference.
- Basic operations include:
  - `git clone`: Copying a repository to your local machine.
  - `git commit`: Saving changes with a descriptive message.
  - `git push`: Uploading local repository content to a remote repository.
  - `git pull`: Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository.

### Setting Up a Git Repository
- Initialize a new Git repository in your WordPress project using `git init`.
- Configure your repository by setting user information with `git config`.

## 5.2 Branching Strategies and Workflows

### Understanding Branches
- Branches allow simultaneous development of different features or versions, keeping the main codebase stable.

### Common Branching Strategies
- **Git Flow**: A rigid branching model designed for release-based workflows.
- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Creating a new branch for each new feature, maintaining a clean master branch.

### Best Practices for Branch Management
- Regularly prune old branches that have been merged or are no longer needed.
- Clearly name branches for their purpose, e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/header-layout`.

## 5.3 Commit Messages and Standards

### Writing Effective Commit Messages
- Clear commit messages are essential for understanding the history of a project.
- A good commit message should succinctly describe what changes were made and why.

### Commit Message Format
- Start with a brief summary (less than 50 characters).
- Optionally, provide a detailed description after a blank line.
- Example of a good commit message:

### Examples of Good and Bad Commit Messages
- Good: `Refactor user login flow for clarity and efficiency`.
- Bad: `Changed stuff`.

## 5.4 Merge Requests and Code Reviews

### Creating and Handling Merge Requests (MRs)
- MRs or Pull Requests are requests to merge your branch into the main branch.
- Before creating an MR, ensure your code is well tested and linted.

This section delves into the essentials of WordPress theme development, focusing on Gutenberg compatibility and the distinction between block and traditional themes.

## 6.1 Theme Structure and Hierarchy

### Understanding the WordPress Template Hierarchy
- WordPress uses a specific hierarchy to determine which template file to use. For example, for a single post, it looks for `single.php`, then `singular.php`, and finally `index.php`.
- Example: To create a custom layout for all posts in the 'news' category, one might create a `category-news.php` file.

### Essential Theme Files and Directories
- A basic theme must have `index.php`, `style.css` (with theme header information), and `functions.php`.
- Organize templates into folders like `/partials` for reusable sections like headers and footers (`header.php`, `footer.php`).

### Custom Templates and Template Parts
- Custom templates can be created for specific needs, like `single-book.php` for a custom post type 'book'.
- Template parts are used for common elements: `get_template_part('partials/navigation');` for navigation.

## 6.2 Developing Gutenberg-Compatible Themes

### Gutenberg’s Impact on Theme Development
- Gutenberg, with its block-based editing, changes how themes handle content. Themes now need to provide styles for blocks.

### Building for Block Compatibility
- Ensure that themes support Gutenberg by adding styles for default blocks and aligning them with the theme’s design.
- Example: Adding styles for the latest posts block to match the theme's typography and color scheme.

### Theme Support for Gutenberg Features
- Enable support for full-width alignment with `add_theme_support('align-wide');`.
- Define a custom color palette in the theme’s `functions.php` file.

## 6.3 Enqueuing Scripts and Styles

### Properly Loading Scripts and Styles
- Scripts and styles should be loaded using `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` within a function hooked to `wp_enqueue_scripts`.

### Managing Dependencies
- Define script dependencies to ensure they load in the correct order. For instance, a custom script dependent on jQuery would list 'jquery' in its dependencies array.

### Best Practices for Performance
- Optimize loading times by minifying scripts and styles. Conditionally load scripts on pages where they are needed.

## 6.4 Theme Customization Options

### Using the Customizer API
- Utilize the WordPress Customizer to add options like site logo, background color, or custom header images.
- Example: Adding a custom color picker for the theme's background.

### Creating Custom Theme Settings
- Introduce custom settings like a switch for a dark/light mode or a layout selector.
- Use `add_setting()` and `add_control()` in `customize_register` action hook.

### Integrating with Gutenberg
- Ensure that customizer settings apply appropriate styles in Gutenberg editor. Use `add_editor_style()` to add custom stylesheets to the editor.

## 6.5 Understanding Block Themes vs. Traditional Themes

### Differences Between Block and Traditional Themes
- Traditional themes use PHP templates and functions, while block themes utilize HTML templates and `theme.json` for styles and global settings.

### Transitioning to Block Themes
- Transitioning involves understanding how to convert PHP templates into HTML templates and moving styles to `theme.json`.

### Benefits and Limitations of Each Approach
- Block themes provide easier layout customization for end-users, while traditional themes offer developers more control over structure and PHP functionality.

## 6.6 Key Components of a Block Theme

### Understanding `theme.json`
- This file controls the global settings and styles of a block theme, like setting default colors, font sizes, and enabling custom spacing.

### Developing Block Templates and Template Parts
- Block templates are HTML files defining the layout using blocks, e.g., `single.html` for single post layouts.
- Template parts are smaller, reusable HTML files for sections like headers and footers.

### Utilizing Block Patterns
- Create block patterns for frequently used design elements. Example: a call-to-action pattern with a button and text.

# 7. Responsive Design Techniques

```css
  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
      .container {
          width: 750px;
      }
  }
```
### Common Breakpoints
#### Standard breakpoints:
- Mobile: up to 768px.
- Tablet: 768px to 1024px.
- Desktop: above 1024px.

### Custom Breakpoints
- Tailor breakpoints to the specific needs of your project or target audience.
- Example: Add a breakpoint at 1200px for large desktop screens if your analytics suggest many users with larger screens.
## 7.3 Responsive Images and Videos
### Using Flexible Image Techniques
- Make images responsive so they don’t overflow their containers on smaller screens.
- Example: CSS rule img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; } ensures images are never wider than their container.
### HTML5 <picture> Element
- Use the <picture> element for different image resolutions and formats based on screen size and device capabilities.
Example:
```
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="large.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 450px)" srcset="medium.jpg">
    <img src="small.jpg" alt="An example image">
</picture>
```
### Responsive Video Embeds
- Use aspect ratio boxes to make embedded videos responsive.
- Example: Wrap the iframe in a div with a padding-top of 56.25% (for a 16:9 aspect ratio) and position the iframe absolutely within.
## 7.4 Testing and Debugging for Various Devices
### Browser Developer Tools
- Use responsive design modes in browser developer tools (like Chrome DevTools) to simulate various devices.
- Test responsiveness and interact with your theme in simulated device modes.
