# Implementing Dynamic Custom Blocks in WordPress

This cheat sheet focuses on implementing dynamic custom blocks in WordPress, assuming the initial setup and scaffolding of the block are already completed.

## Overview

Dynamic custom blocks interact with the WordPress database or use PHP to dynamically generate content. This guide dives directly into the implementation aspects.

## Step 1: Preparing for Dynamic Content

Start by identifying the dynamic content your block will handle. This could be content fetched from the database, dynamically generated based on user input, or any server-side processed content.

## Step 2: Modifying the Block JSON Configuration

Edit your block's `block.json` file to include a `render_callback` function. This function will handle the server-side rendering of the block.

```json
{
    "apiVersion": 2,
    "name": "create-block/my-custom-block",
    "title": "My Custom Block",
    ...
    "render_callback": "my_custom_block_render_callback"
}
```
## Step 3: Creating the PHP Render Callback Function
In your plugin's main PHP file, create the render callback function. This function will output the dynamic content of the block.
```
function my_custom_block_render_callback( $attributes, $content ) {
    // Implement your dynamic rendering logic here.
    // This function should return the HTML content to be displayed by the block.
    return 'Dynamic Content Here';
}

```
## Step 4: Registering the Block with the Render Callback
Ensure your block type is registered with the render callback function.
```
function register_my_custom_block() {
    register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/build/my-custom-block', array(
        'render_callback' => 'my_custom_block_render_callback',
    ));
}
add_action( 'init', 'register_my_custom_block' );
```
## Step 5: Handling Block Attributes
Define any necessary attributes in your block.json file. These attributes can be accessed within the render callback function to customize the block's output.

## Step 6: Adding Server-Side Logic
Implement the server-side logic in the render callback function. This could involve querying the database, processing data, or generating dynamic HTML content based on the block's attributes.

## Step 7: Testing and Debugging
Test the block in various scenarios and ensure the dynamic content is rendered correctly both in the editor and on the front end.
Utilize debugging techniques, such as logging and breakpoints, to troubleshoot any issues.
